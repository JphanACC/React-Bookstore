 ## Global Books Garden
A global bookstore website where users can order books based on their currency. This application also allows admin accounts to add and edit items to the stores. The external API will translate the DB’s currency to the User’s frontend, and whenever the user orders the items the currency of the order will be translated back to US. <br>

•	Register.<br> 
•	Login/Logout.<br>
